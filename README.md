## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS, PostCSS (for auto-prefixing)
- Flexbox
- Vite.js
- WebP automation (Node.js)
- LiveReload

### What I learned

- I learned how to structure semantic HTML properly.
- I finally understood how to center elements perfectly with Flexbox.
- I learned how to automate image optimization using Node.js.
- I learned how to automate CSS browser-prefixing using Vite.js.
- I learned a smart spacing technique in Flexbox using negative margins.
- I learned how to set up my first public GitHub repository.
- I learned that pathing to a 32px by 32px favicon in my HTML's head results in the favicon becoming the website's icon along with the website's `<title>`.

### Continued development

- Responsive layouts
- CSS Grid
- Animations
- React/Next.js integration
- Performance optimization
- ARIA attributes integration
- Eventually focus on backend development (Databases, APIs, DSA, etc.)

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - For code debugging and simple solutions like the negative margin trick.
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - For manual spacing research via rectangles and frames along the website's layout concepts.
- [Box Shadow CSS Generator](https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - To help perfect box-shadow styles similar to the concept design.
